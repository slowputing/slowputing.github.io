## Coming soon

This page is merely a placeholder at the moment. The goal here is to share my experience with slow computing. Slow in this context needs to be understood as in [Slow Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_movement_(culture)). It's indeed about making things right rather than making things fast with your computing activities.
