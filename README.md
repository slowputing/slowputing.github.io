The goal here is to share my experience with slow computing and possibly help others who might feel overwhelmed by the ever increasing pace at which information technology evolves. 

Indeed, slow in this context must to be understood as in the [slow movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_movement_(culture)). It's really about making things right rather than making things fast with our daily computing.
