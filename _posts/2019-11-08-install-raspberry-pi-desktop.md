[The Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/about/) does an amazing job in favor of a wide [Linux adoption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_adoption) which we're all for as you imagine. If you've been hesitant to finally give Linux a try then maybe [this guide](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/install-raspberry-pi-desktop) could very well be your ticket. My experience is it gets Linux running on an older PC right out of the box with minimal hassle.
