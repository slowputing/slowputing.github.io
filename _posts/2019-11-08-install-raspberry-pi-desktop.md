[Linux adoption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_adoption) benefits massively from the work of the good guys at [The Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/about/). If you've been hesitant to give Linux a try then [this guide](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/install-raspberry-pi-desktop) might very well be your ticket. My experience is it gets Linux running on an older PC right out of the box with minimal hassle.
